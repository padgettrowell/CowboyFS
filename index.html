        <h3>Welcome to CowboyFS.</h3>

<p>CowboyFS was authored as a replacement for the remote file access feature of Microsoft’s Windows Home Server. </p>

<h3>With CowboyFS you:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get to configure any number of libraries – with each library representing a root folder of content you want to allow users to browse</li>
<li>Can access the hosted site from a variety of mobile devices including iPhones, iPad’s and Android phones.  CowboyFS is built using jQuery mobile and is optimised for access by mobile clients</li>
<li>Get really simple deployment and practically zero overhead on your server. CowboyFS doesn’t install a database, maintain a document index or run any other service (other than hosting the very small web site) that consumes system resources</li>
<li>Get to experience really fast browsing and list filtering</li>
<li>Are free to use pull the source and modify it in any way your see fit</li>
<li>Are free to contribute your changes back to the community</li>
</ul><h3>With CowboyFS you don’t get:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cross library file search (yet!)</li>
<li>To search within file contents</li>
<li>To mount libraries on non-local drives. Sorry, but CowboyFS has been optimised for size, speed and simplicity.  The cost of this is that network drives cannot be added as a library</li>
</ul><h3>What do you need to run it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>CowboyFS is an MVC 4 application written in C# on the .NET 4.5 platform. To host an instance of CowboyFS you need an IIS web server. Any flavour of Windows since XP or Windows Server 2003 should do.</li>
</ul><h3>What's it look like?</h3>
