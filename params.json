{"body":"### Welcome to CowboyFS.\r\nCowboyFS was authored as a replacement for the remote file access feature of Microsoft’s Windows Home Server. \r\n\r\n### With CowboyFS you:\r\n* Get to configure any number of libraries – with each library representing a root folder of content you want to allow users to browse\r\n* Can access the hosted site from a variety of mobile devices including iPhones, iPad’s and Android phones.  CowboyFS is built using jQuery mobile and is optimised for access by mobile clients\r\n* Get really simple deployment and practically zero overhead on your server. CowboyFS doesn’t install a database, maintain a document index or run any other service (other than hosting the very small web site) that consumes system resources\r\n* Get to experience really fast browsing and list filtering\r\n* Are free to use pull the source and modify it in any way your see fit\r\n* Are free to contribute your changes back to the community\r\n\r\n### With CowboyFS you don’t get:\r\n* Cross library file search (yet!)\r\n* To search within file contents\r\n* To mount libraries on non-local drives. Sorry, but CowboyFS has been optimised for size, speed and simplicity.  The cost of this is that network drives cannot be added as a library\r\n\r\n### What do you need to run it?\r\n* CowboyFS is an MVC 4 application written in C# on the .NET 4.5 platform. To host an instance of CowboyFS you need an IIS web server. Any flavour of Windows since XP or Windows Server 2003 should do.\r\n\r\n### What's it look like?\r\n![Screen shot](https://raw.github.com/padgettrowell/CowboyFS/master/src/CowboyFS.Web.UI/img/CowboyFS-demo.png)","tagline":"CowboyFS is a web based file browser.
